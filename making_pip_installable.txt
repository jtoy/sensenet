Making project PIP installable.

For all the details follow the link - https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/ 

Requirements:
1. Setup.py - The file containing the global setup() function required to specify details of project requirements.
2. Setup.cfg - Contains default options for Setup.py file.

Optional requirements:
1. README.md or README.rst
2. Manifest.in
3. License.txt

Steps to follow :
On terminal - 
1. pip install twine (required for uploading project to PyPI later)

2. pip install -e (Optional - required if project is in development mode)

3. python setup.py sdist (creates unbuilt source distribution)

4. pip install wheel (a built package that can be installed without going through 'build' process)

5. python setup.py bdist_wheel (build the wheel)

Create an account on PyPI.

6. twine upload dist/* (The newly created dist folder in the project's root directory is uploaded on the PyPI)
